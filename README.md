## Project description

The project was designed as a ring store. Each ring must have its own brand and size (it can have one or more sizes). Logged-in users can place an order and order products in the desired sizes and quantities.
The functionalities in the project were done based on the role of the user. 
**Unauthorized users** can search for products and brands and register.
**Authorized users** can order a product, rate it from 1 to 5, cancel / delete their orders and update and delete their account.
**Admin** can insert, update and delete products.
